Like usual life gets the better of me. I won't bore you with the details.
More importantly I've managed to secure the all important Fish Pie recipe. I've
searched for this online and never come across it.

It's a news paper clipping titled "Celebrity Square Meals, Richard Bacon's fish pie".
A quick Google suggests this originates from The Independent.

If someone can point me to the recipe from another source / copyright owner I'll
happily remove this and link directly there.

### Fish Pie Recipe

#### Ingredients (Serves 4)

* 1 Small Onion (thickly sliced)
* 2 Cloves
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 pint milk
* 1/2 pint double cream
* 1lb cod fillet or haddock (skin on)
* 8oz undyed smoked cod or haddock fillet
* 4 eggs
* 4oz Butter
* 1 3/4oz plain flour
* 5tbsp chopped flatleaf parsley
* Freshly grated nutmeg
* 2 1/2lb potatoes
* 1 egg yoke
* salt & white pepper

#### Method

Put the onion, cloves, bay leaf, cream, cod, smoked fish and three quarters of
the milk in a pan and simmer for eight minutes.

Remove the fish and strain the liquid into a jug. Take off the skin and bones
and flake the fish into the bottom of a large dish.

Hard-boil, peel and slice the eggs and put them on top of the fish.

Melt the butter in a pan, add the flour and heat for 1 minute. Take the pan
off the heat again and stir in the cooking liquor. Simmer for 10 minutes,
stirring.

Take the pan off the heat again, stir in the parsley and add nutmeg, salt and
pepper. Pour over the fish and chill in the fridge for an hour or so.

Make mashed potato, using the egg yoke and remaining butter. Season. Beat in
some milk until it's soft.

Pre-heat the oven to 100C/gas mark 6. Spread the potato over the fish and bake
for 35-40 minutes.
